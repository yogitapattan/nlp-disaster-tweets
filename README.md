# nlp-disaster-tweets
Exploration Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches for predicting whether a tweet is related to a real disaster or not.

- Developed a machine learning model to predict whether a tweet is related to a real disaster or not.
- Explored a range of NLP techniques, including feature engineering and word embeddings.
- Implemented machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and LSTM Neural Networks.
- Conducted preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the text data for analysis.
- Optimized the model's accuracy and evaluated its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Leveraged a dataset of 7600 hand-classified tweets to train and test the model.
- Gained insights into NLP techniques, feature engineering, and the application of different machine-learning algorithms in text classification tasks.
- Improved understanding of analyzing real-time data from social media platforms like Twitter.

Some real-time applications of this project:
1. Disaster Monitoring and Early Warning Systems: The developed model can be integrated into a real-time monitoring system to analyze tweets and identify potential disaster situations. It can help disaster relief organizations and emergency response teams receive early warnings and take proactive measures.

2. News and Media Analysis: Media organizations can utilize the model to automatically classify tweets related to disasters. This can aid in real-time news coverage and provide accurate and timely information to the public during emergency situations.
